# Practical-File-Template-Creator

*While making a Practical file, we have to write and format the various  things (like the word "Code" or "Output" etc) again and again . Well now this can be done automatically. All you need to do is copy your code from your IDE or text editor and screenshots of your output and paste it in this Practical File Template. Choose the settings that you want for different parts of the Practical file and a Practical File Template will be generated. (It also includes an index table)*
